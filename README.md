### Project Organization

Each member was responsible for one of the bitwise operations. The project is broken into the following components:

- **`clz.c` – Count Leading Zeros**  
  *Implemented by: Haider Beg*  
  Implements a function that counts the number of leading zero bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer using only bitwise operations.

- **`endian.c` – Endian Swap**  
  *Implemented by: Jake Moseley*  
  Swaps the endianness of a 32-bit unsigned integer by reversing the order of its bytes using bitwise manipulation.

- **`rotate.c` – Rotate Right**  
  *Implemented by: Hasan Walid*  
  Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer to the right by a user-specified number of positions using bitwise operations.

- **`parity.c` – Parity**  
  *Implemented by: Oyindamola Bade-Ojo*  
  Determines the parity of a 32-bit unsigned integer (whether the number of 1-bits is even or odd).

- **`major1.c` – Main Driver**  
  *Implemented by: Haider Beg & Jake Moseley*  
  Contains the main loop and interactive menu logic to select and run each operation.

- **`major1.h` – Header File**  
  *Implemented by: Haider Beg*  
  Declares all functions and includes necessary standard libraries and dependencies.

- **`README.md`**  
  *Written by: Jake Moseley*  
  Contains project description, member responsibilities, and build/run instructions.

### Known Bugs or Issues

- There are currently **no known bugs**.  
  All functions have been tested and verified to work correctly with a variety of inputs.
