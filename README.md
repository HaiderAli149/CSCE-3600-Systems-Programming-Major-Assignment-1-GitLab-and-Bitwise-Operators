Organization of the Project:
    - Count Leading Zeros (clz.c) - Haider Beg
        - Implements a function that counts the number of leading zero bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer using only bitwise operations.
    - Endian Swap (endian.c) - Jake Moseley
        - Swaps the endianness of a 32-bit unsigned integer by reversing the order of the bytes using bitwise manipulation.
    - Rotate Right (rotate.c) - Hasan Walid
        - Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer to the right by a specified number of positions.
    - Parity (parity.c) - Oyindamola Bade-Ojo
        - Determines the parity (even or odd number of 1s) of the 32-bit unsigned integer.
    - major1.c - Haider Beg
        - Contains main loop and menu logic.
    - major1.h - Haider Beg
        - Declares all functions and includes necessary headers.
    - README.md - Jake Moseley

Known Bugs or Problems:
    - There are currently no known bugs or problems with the code. All functions have been implemented and tested successfully.
